# project1

<!-- Hey friends and welcome!
Disney’s Cruella recently came out in theaters and on Disney+. In honor of the fur-loving fashionista, I thought it would be a fun tribute if I made a single-page application about her love of fashion and furs!

This webpage is focused on fetching to a public API server and on a Javascript file to connect and append to the DOM. 

I used VS Code on a MAC OS Catalina system To create this project. -->ß
